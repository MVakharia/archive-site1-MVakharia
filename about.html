								<h1>About</h1>
							</header>

							<p>
								I'm 28 years old, and I live in the UK. I graduated from London College of Communication with a BA in Game Design back in 2014,
								and have spent my time since then dabbling in a lot of different things related to game development, IT, and music.
							</p>

							<p>
								I've used Unity on and off for a total of 5 years since 2013. Since 2019 I've travelled the country performing hardware engineering work for a number of companies in the EPOS and ATM sectors,
								and prior to that I was a fast food delivery driver.
							</p>

							<p>
								In 2021 I started learning HTML and CSS, and I applied my new-found knowledge to heavily modify a <a href="https://html5up.net/editorial">template</a> and build this website,
								which is currently being hosted on GitHub Pages.
							</p>

								<h2>Interests</h2>
							</header>

							<p>
								I like to code as a hobby as much as I like to do it commercially, and am always willing to learn and expand my knowledge of programming,
								scripting, the Unity engine, and games/web/software development in general.
							</p>

							<p>
								In my spare time I enjoy playing a wide range of video games, both competitively and casually.
								I like to study some of the games I play in order to improve at them, and sometimes write up my thoughts on games that interest me.
							</p>

							<p>I’m an avid watcher/reader of anime and manga, as well as TV shows and movies based on comic book fiction. </p>

							<p>I also like to watch crime and police procedural fiction that have a unique spin on them that set them apart from other shows in the genre.</p>

							<p>I enjoy cooking and experimenting with new recipes, and watching cooking channels on YouTube.</p>

								<h2>Coding and scripting</h2>
							</header>

							<p>
								As a programmer, my focus is on writing clean code that is easily readable by anybody who views it,
								and fully understandable by myself even at a glance, even if I happen to not view it for some time.
							</p>

							<p>
								I refactor my code as often as necessary,
								carefully adhering to a set of strict programming principles in order to prevent bugs from appearing (to the best of my ability).
							</p>

							<p>I write easily maintainable and extendable code that can be reused and repurposed to fit a clients’ and/or my needs.</p>

								<h2>Hobbies</h2>
							</header>

							<p>
								My main video games are Overwatch, Minecraft, and Yu-Gi-Oh. I also like to play racing games,
								old and new, arcade and simulation alike, using my racing wheel setup.
							</p>

							<p>
								As a competitive gamer, I watch popular streamers play these games on Twitch and watch their gameplay and analysis videos,
								as well as their how-to guides on YouTube, in order to improve.
							</p>

							<p>
								Occasionally I also write up my thoughts on the state of video games and game franchises I’ve watched and played over the years,
								and where they can go next, and am looking to post some of these write-ups on my website in the near future.
